# sketch-plugins
All the plugins I use regularly, in one repo, for easy updating.

Note: this repo probably isn't really that useful to you directly, but how it works might be if you have the same problem I do.

## Why have you done this?

Because Sketch Toolbox doesn't update plugins any more, and I'm tired of doing it manually. I want to do one "check for updates" thing every so often, and have it magically happen for me.

## How?

Each plugin I use is added to this repo as a submodule. This approach isn't intended for working on the individual plugins ( there's probably a way of doing that, it's just not something I'm doing at the moment).
